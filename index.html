				<p class="storypart1"><br>Voter turnout in Syracuse’s mayoral election was 10% lower in 2021 than it was in 2017, data from the <a href="http://ongov.net/elections/results.html">Onondaga County Board of Elections shows</a>.<br><br> Incumbent Mayor Ben Walsh won re-election in the Nov. 2 general election over challengers Khalid Bey, a democrat, and the Republican Janet Burman. But only around 28% of Syracuse’s base of registered voters participated in the election.<br><br> In 2017, when Walsh initially became mayor, turnout was higher —  around 38%. <br><br> Mark Brockway, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said that political fatigue from the 2020 presidential election played a role in the decreased turnout. He also said that the presence of a popular incumbent, like Walsh, often makes voters feel like participation is less important.<br><br>“The idea was that the race was already decided and when you have a non-competitive race, turnout is lower across the board,” Brockway said. “It was pretty clear that Mayor Walsh was going to win, and so people didn’t feel like their vote was going to matter.” <br></p></div>

				<p class="storypart2"> <br>Walsh won the 2021 election by almost 6,500 votes. He won by under 4,000 in 2017.<br><br>The closest challenger in both elections was a Democrat — Bey in 2021 and Juanita Perez Williams in 2017. A Republican <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/11/see-winner-of-every-syracuse-mayors-race-over-last-100-years.html">has not served</a> as mayor of the city since Roy Bernardi left office in 2001. Walsh remains the only member of the Independent party to hold the office.<br><br>In the summer of 2021, Bey narrowly won the democratic primary for mayor against Michael Greene, who had been endorsed by the party. The difference between the candidates’ vote tallies was just <a href="https://www.dailyorange.com/2021/11/syracuse-university-mayoral-election-results/">36 votes</a>. Burman won her Republican primary by 269 votes, the data shows.<br><br>According to <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/06/syracuse-mayoral-primary-turnout-lowest-in-half-a-century.html">syracuse.com’s election coverage</a>, the primary elections saw the lowest turnout in Syracuse for 36 years. Only 14% of Democrats and 9% of Republicans cast early or in-person ballots.<br><br> Brockway teaches PSC 121, American National Government and Politics, which has an average class enrollment of 150.</p></div>
